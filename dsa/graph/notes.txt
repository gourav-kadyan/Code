graph is a type of data structure which is a combination of nodes and edges.

graph are two types :

   undirected graph : in which edges are not directed to single nodes on a both of nodes like  a-b and   b-a  

   directd graph : in this edges are directd to single nodes on a both of nodes like a -> b 


node -- a type of entity in which we store a type of data

edge -- connection ( connecting nodes)

degree -- like nodes a so a ke kitne edge connected hai 

but in directed graph 

    indegree -- kitne edges nodes ke taraf aa rhi hai

    outdegree -- kitne edges nodes se jaa rhi hai



weighted graph -- isme aise hota hai jb tumhare edges koi value hai usse hm weight bolte hai so uss graph ko hmm ye khte hai 

weighted directd graph -- jiss directed graph ke edges pe weight ho 


path -- ek rasta hota hai jisme any nodes ek baar he aati hai like a - b - c is a path but a - b - c -a is   not a path same goes for directed graph bss usme ye dhyan rkhna hai ki edge kis trf directed hai 


cyclic graph -- jiss graph mei cycle bnn rhi ho like hmm use aise node pe pahoch gye ho jisse tum already travel krr skte ho 

same goes for cyclic directed graph or cyclic weighted directed graph 


acyclic graph -- jiss graph mei tumhe cycle na mille



    REPRESENTATION of  GRAPH :

    1 - Adjacency matrix -- hmm 2d matix se got it krr li ki ye nodes iss nodes se connected hai ya nhi 0 & 1 
                            uske index hmare nodes ho jayegi

    2 - Adjacency list -- chk implementation

    

    BFS - breath first search
