1. many algorithmic technique based on recursion like
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Backtracking
    - Divide and Conquror(quick sort, merge sort, binary search)

2. have inheriting problems like 
    - tower of hanoi
    - dfs based search(inorder, preorder, postorder traversal of tree)   

3. easy to implentation
4. tail recursion == is trigger/happen when the last is line in func is 
                     calling func

                     It is very efficint in comaparison to other recursive func
                     whose next recursion call is in mid not the last one

                     we cannot convert every non tail recursive to tail like merge sort
note -- chk rope cutting problem 
     -- chk generate subset 
     -- chk tower of hanoi 
     -- chk subset of sum   
     -- chk string permutation
